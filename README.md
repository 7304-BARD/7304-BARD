# W[rec]k Cards

W[rec]k Cards is a mobile application, targeting the Android and iOS platforms, for the Georgia Tech Baseball recruitment team. 
It allows recruiters to find player prospects they are interested in and save notes about them. 
It also allows them to track prospects to see which tournaments they are playing in.
